> 1. Laksa
Laksa is one of the ultimate demonstrations of the combination of Chinese and Malay flavors and ingredients all in a single bowl. Noodles, often rice noodles, make up the foundation and starch of a bowl of laksa, followed by a gravy or curry, some pieces of protein, and often some vegetables and herbs.
- 叨沙
- 喇沙（馬來語：Laksa）或叻沙是一道起源於南洋的麵食料理，為馬來西亞和新加坡的代表性料理。叻沙有非常多不同的種類，不同族群和地方對於叻沙的做法和味道也有極大差異，一般馬來西亞和新加坡華人所指的叻沙多為咖哩叻沙(Curry Laksa)或亞參叻沙(Asam Laksa)。其中亞參叻沙在2011年被美國有線電視新聞網絡（CNN）旗下的旅遊網站CNNGO，選為全球50大美食中的第7名，而咖哩叻沙則被赫芬頓郵報（The Huffington Post）評選為死前必嘗的世界十大美食之一。

> 2. Bak Kut Teh
Literally translated to pork bone tea, bak kut teh is a dish that’s popular throughout Malaysia and Singapore with Chinese origins. Although one would think the pork is cooked in tea, tea is not actually included in the recipe, but according to Wikipedia, it got its name because strong tea is consumed along with the pork soup to wash down the grease.
- 肉骨茶
- 你沒有讀錯，英文因是福建話台語發音。畢竟新加坡老一輩的華人大多講福建話。新加坡與馬來西亞都愛吃肉骨茶，差別就在於湯頭。新加坡湯底是白湯胡椒湯，馬來西亞是黑湯藥材湯。

補充：隨著肉骨茶在東南亞以至亞洲及世界各地流傳，其烹飪風格亦隨著當時當地的華人而有所影響。 常見的肉骨茶風味可以分為以下三種：
- 潮州派：顏色較淺，但湯裡用上更多的胡椒，所以有較重的胡椒味。
- 福建派：顏色較深，因為用上較多豉油（黑醬油）作調味，所以有較重的藥材味。
- 廣東派：加入中國藥酒，以加強其藥效。
- 現時在新加坡，潮州派較為盛行，而在馬來西亞則以福建派較為盛行。

> 3. Hokkien Mee
Along with Char Kway Teow (coming up soon), Hokkien Mee is one of the most popular fried noodle hawker dishes in Singapore. It’s a dish that has roots in China’s Fujian province (which is where the Hokkien people are originally from), that has now been adopted into Malaysia and Singapore.
- 福建麵
- 你沒有讀錯，英文因是福建話台語發音。新加坡有些小販中心早上就在賣這類食食物，不像台式早餐偏愛蛋餅豆漿或者三明治。

> 4. Chicken Rice
Although it’s just a simple combination of boiled chicken, paired with flavorful rice and sauce, this Hainanese influenced dish, ranks as one of the most popular and beloved dishes to eat in Singapore (it’s also extremely popular in Thailand, known as khao man gai).
- 雞飯

> 5. Char Kway Teow
When it comes to stir fried noodles in Singapore, one of the ultimate local favorites is char kway teow, a dish of flat wide rice noodles, stir fried with egg, a sauce of dark soy sauce, shrimp paste, a bit of chili, and often some Chinese sausage and blood cockles to finish it off.
- 炒粿條
- 你沒有讀錯，英文因是福建話台語發音。新加坡有些小販中心早上就在賣這類食食物，不像台式早餐偏愛蛋餅豆漿或者三明治。

> 6. Carrot Cake (Chai Tow Kway)
Another one of the standard Singapore dishes that you’ll find at just about every hawker food centre throughout the city is chai tow kway, which is very commonly referred to as a carrot cake.
- 蘿蔔糕
- 新加坡有白根黑兩種作法。黑得比較偏甜。

> 7. Wanton Mee
One of the popular Chinese Cantonese dishes that’s available at just about all hawker centre food courts throughout Singapore is wantan mee, the familiar combination of yellow egg noodles, wanton dumplings, some small boiled vegetables, and often some slices of char siu. Given a choice of noodles, egg noodles are one of my favorites.
- 雲吞麵

> 8. Fish Bee Hoon
Yet another popular noodle dish that’s commonly found as a Singapore food is fish bee hoon, fish with noodles.
Bee hoon is a type of rice noodle, which as I was eating, reminded me specifically of some bowls of noodles I ate when I was in the Guangxi province of China… and only to look them up online, and they are the same version, originally from Guilin, China, and quite popularly served at hawker stalls in Singapore.
- 魚米粉

> 9. Bak Chor Mee
Although there are similar versions of the dish served in China and throughout Southeast Asia, according to this article on Yahoo, bak chor mee is a true Singaporean dish. Bak chor mee, meaning minced pork and noodles, usually consists of egg noodles, topped with minced pork, some other pork ingredients, and a sauce made with vinegar, chili, and soy sauce.
- 肉挫麵
- 也是常見的一種小販中心美食，類似台灣的扁麵乾麵再加上豬肝 肉碎 魚丸等等，再淋上醬汁。

> 10. Oyster omelette (Orh Luak)
Popular and available throughout much of Asia and Southeast Asia, and also a favorite of mine in Thailand, is an oyster omelette, known in Singapore as orh luak.
- 蚵煎
- 幾乎是台灣的蚵仔煎，差別在於新加坡的蚵煎 太白粉勾芡較乾，少青菜。

> 11. Yong Tau Foo
Yong tau foo, which literally translates to stuffed bean curd, is a traditional Chinese dish, that’s especially common among Hakka Chinese, who are very well represented throughout Singapore. There are many different kinds of yong tau foo, and I think many vendors have their own mix and style.
- 釀豆腐

> 12. Roast Meat / Roast Duck
Different types of roast meat, typically including pork, pork belly, duck, and chicken, are widely available in Singapore at Cantonese style roast meat restaurants. The meat, is all marinated in a variety of different seasonings and roasted until the skin is golden and slightly charred for ultimate tender and juiciness and that amazing smoky flavor.
- 粿汁

> 13. Peranakan Food
The word Peranakan refers to a group of people, most originally Hokkien, Hakka, and Teochew, that were born somewhere on the Malay Peninsula and the surrounding islands – within the Straits of Malacca. Peranakan people have a unique culture that blends Chinese, Malay, and even Western influences. There’s no better way to learn about the Peranakan culture than through food, and it’s a thrilling cuisine that’s as diverse and flavorful as their history.
- 娘惹菜

> 14. Zi Char Meal
Zi char (also spelled cze char) is the Hokkien Chinese word for cooked food, usually made to order. In less complicated terms, it refers to any Chinese style restaurant that has a big menu of mainly stir fried and deep fried dishes that are prepared and eaten family style.

> 15. Kaya Toast, Coffee, Soft Boiled Egg
Blending the Malay and Chinese culture, Singapore has a strong traditional social coffee shop culture. Traditionally known as kopitiams, open air coffee shops are a place to have a cup of coffee or tea, a few snacks, and just sit and chat or spend time with friends.

> 16. Rojak
Truly a contrasting combination of both textures and flavors, rojak is the ultimate concoction for throwing your taste buds into a sweet and salty frenzy. Since rojak literally just means “mixture,” there are all sorts of different types, and in Singapore both Chinese rojak and Indian Rojak are common at food hawker centres.

> 17. Satay
Although originally from Indonesia with influence from India and the Middle East, satay (or sate) is very popular throughout Southeast Asia, and common to find at hawker food centres throughout Singapore.
- 沙嗲

> 18. Ice Kacang
It seems that just about every country throughout the world has their own version of a crushed or shaved ice dessert, and in Singapore that treat is called an ice kacang.

> 19. Durian
Although durian is the only food on this list that needs no cooking preparation and is perfect in its all natural state of being, I had to include it because it’s such an obsession in Singapore, and it can be treated like an entire meal… and if I’m being honest with you, it was an excuse so that I could justify eating durian in Singapore. Luckily, I didn’t have any trouble convincing my wife that we needed to have during in Singapore, her being a lover of the King of Fruits as well.
- 榴槤

> 20. Nasi Padang
Back in 2009, I took my first trip to Sumatra, Indonesia, and I was introduced to Nasi Padang, rice with a selection of different dishes originally from Padang in Sumatra.

> 21. Nasi Lemak
Nasi lemak is one of the most well known Malay dishes, and when I’m in Malaysia, it’s one of the first meals I try to seek out as soon as I arrive. So I was also excited to taste a Singapore version of nasi lemak.

> 22. Murtabak
Originally an Arab food, but popular throughout Singapore and influenced by Indian flavors as well, a murtabak is yet another example of a beautiful fusion of cultures through food. Murtabak is essentially a stuffed roti, that can be filled with a choice of different fillings.

> 23. Chili Crab / Black Pepper Crab
Often referred to as one of the national dishes of Singapore, chili crab is one of the most beloved special family dishes in Singapore, and it’s among the most famous things to eat in the city when you’re visiting as well.

> 24. Sambal Stingray
Known for being served at open air bbq restaurants and food stalls in Singapore is sambal stingray. The stingray is cut into steak sizes pieces, marinated in a sambal sauce made from chilies, shallots, cane sugar, sometimes tamarind, and calamansi juice. The stingray is then wrapped in a banana leaf and grilled over, nowadays a hot griddle, while remaining in the banana leaf.

> 25. Fish Head Curry
As you probably know by now, I’m a huge food lover, and while I enjoyed eating everything on this list of Singapore food, there are a couple dishes that top all the rest (for me), one of them being fish head curry.
