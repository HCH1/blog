## intro
Education in Singapore is managed by the Ministry of Education (MOE), which controls the development and administration of state schools receiving taxpayers' funding, but also has an advisory and supervisory role in respect of private schools. For both private and state schools, there are variations in the extent of autonomy in their curriculum, scope of taxpayers' aid and funding, tuition burden on the students, and admission policy.

新加坡的教育由**教育部(MOE)管理**，控制着接受纳税人资金的公立学校的发展和管理，但对私立学校也有咨询和监督作用。无论是私立学校还是公立学校，其课程自主程度、纳税人援助和资助的范围、学生的学费负担和入学政策都各不相同。

Education spending usually makes up about 20 percent of the annual national budget, which subsidises state education and government-assisted private education for Singaporean citizens and funds the Edusave programme. Non-citizens bear significantly higher costs of educating their children in Singapore government and government-aided schools. In 2000 the Compulsory Education Act codified compulsory education for children of primary school age (excepting those with disabilities), and made it a criminal offence for parents to fail to enroll their children in school and ensure their regular attendance. Exemptions are allowed for homeschooling or full-time religious institutions, but parents must apply for exemption from the Ministry of Education and meet a minimum benchmark.The education system in Singapore is consistently ranked as one of the highest in the world by the OECD. It is believed that this comes from the style of teaching that is implemented in Singapore. Teachers focus on making sure that each of their students thoroughly move through the syllabus before moving on. By doing this teachers in Singapore teach a much more narrow but deeper type of instruction.

教育支出通常占年度国家**预算的20%左右**，用于资助新加坡公民的国立教育和政府资助的私立教育，并资助Edusave项目。在新加坡政府和政府资助的学校，非公民子女的教育成本要高得多。2000年，《义务教育法》将小学年龄儿童(残疾儿童除外)的义务教育纳入了，并将父母不让孩子上学并保证他们正常上学定为刑事犯罪。家庭学校或全日制宗教机构可以获得豁免，但家长必须申请教育部的豁免，并达到最低标准。新加坡的教育系统一直被经济合作与发展组织列为世界上最高的教育系统之一。据信，这源于新加坡的教学风格。教师的重点是确保每个学生在继续学习之前都彻底地浏览了教学大纲。通过这种方式，新加坡的老师教授的是一种更狭窄但更深入的教学方式

The main language of instruction in Singapore is English, which was officially designated the first language within the local education system in 1987. English is the first language learned by half the children by the time they reach preschool age and becomes the primary medium of instruction by the time they reach primary school. Although Malay, Mandarin and Tamil are also official languages, English is the language of instruction for nearly all subjects except the official Mother Tongue languages and the literatures of those languages; these are generally not taught in English, although there is provision for the use of English at the initial stages. Certain schools, such as secondary schools under the Special Assistance Plan (SAP), encourage a richer use of the mother tongue and may occasionally teach subjects in Mandarin Chinese. A few schools have been experimenting with curricula that integrates language subjects with mathematics and the sciences, using both English and a second language.

新加坡的主要教学语言是英语，**英语于1987年被官方指定为当地教育系统的第一语言**。英语是一半儿童在学龄前学习的第一语言，在他们上小学时成为主要的教学媒介。虽然马来语、国语和泰米尔语也是官方语言，但除了官方母语和这些语言的文献外，英语几乎是所有科目的教学语言;这些课程一般不使用英语教学，尽管在最初阶段有使用英语的规定。某些学校，例如“特殊援助计划”(SAP)下的中学，鼓励学生更广泛地使用母语，并可能偶尔教授普通话课程。一些学校已经在试验将语言学科与数学和科学结合起来的课程，使用英语和第二语言。
