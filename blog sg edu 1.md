## intro
Education in Singapore is managed by the **Ministry of Education (MOE)**, which controls the development and administration of state schools receiving taxpayers' funding, but also has an advisory and supervisory role in respect of private schools. For both private and state schools, there are variations in the extent of autonomy in their curriculum, scope of taxpayers' aid and funding, tuition burden on the students, and admission policy.

新加坡的教育由**教育部(MOE)管理**，控制着接受纳税人资金的公立学校的发展和管理，但对私立学校也有咨询和监督作用。无论是私立学校还是公立学校，其课程自主程度、纳税人援助和资助的范围、学生的学费负担和入学政策都各不相同。

Education spending usually makes up about **20 percent of the annual national budget**, which subsidises state education and government-assisted private education for Singaporean citizens and funds the Edusave programme. Non-citizens bear significantly higher costs of educating their children in Singapore government and government-aided schools. In 2000 the Compulsory Education Act codified compulsory education for children of primary school age (excepting those with disabilities), and made it a criminal offence for parents to fail to enroll their children in school and ensure their regular attendance. Exemptions are allowed for homeschooling or full-time religious institutions, but parents must apply for exemption from the Ministry of Education and meet a minimum benchmark.The education system in Singapore is consistently ranked as one of the highest in the world by the OECD. It is believed that this comes from the style of teaching that is implemented in Singapore. Teachers focus on making sure that each of their students thoroughly move through the syllabus before moving on. By doing this teachers in Singapore teach a much more narrow but deeper type of instruction.

教育支出通常占年度国家**预算的20%左右**，用于资助新加坡公民的国立教育和政府资助的私立教育，并资助Edusave项目。在新加坡政府和政府资助的学校，非公民子女的教育成本要高得多。2000年，《义务教育法》将小学年龄儿童(残疾儿童除外)的义务教育纳入了，并将父母不让孩子上学并保证他们正常上学定为刑事犯罪。家庭学校或全日制宗教机构可以获得豁免，但家长必须申请教育部的豁免，并达到最低标准。新加坡的教育系统一直被经济合作与发展组织列为世界上最高的教育系统之一。据信，这源于新加坡的教学风格。教师的重点是确保每个学生在继续学习之前都彻底地浏览了教学大纲。通过这种方式，新加坡的老师教授的是一种更狭窄但更深入的教学方式

The **main language of instruction in Singapore is English**, which was officially designated the first language within the local education system in 1987. English is the first language learned by half the children by the time they reach preschool age and becomes the primary medium of instruction by the time they reach primary school. Although Malay, Mandarin and Tamil are also official languages, English is the language of instruction for nearly all subjects except the official Mother Tongue languages and the literatures of those languages; these are generally not taught in English, although there is provision for the use of English at the initial stages. Certain schools, such as secondary schools under the Special Assistance Plan (SAP), encourage a richer use of the mother tongue and may occasionally teach subjects in Mandarin Chinese. A few schools have been experimenting with curricula that integrates language subjects with mathematics and the sciences, using both English and a second language.

新加坡的主要教学语言是英语，**英语于1987年被官方指定为当地教育系统的第一语言**。英语是一半儿童在学龄前学习的第一语言，在他们上小学时成为主要的教学媒介。虽然马来语、国语和泰米尔语也是官方语言，但除了官方母语和这些语言的文献外，英语几乎是所有科目的教学语言;这些课程一般不使用英语教学，尽管在最初阶段有使用英语的规定。某些学校，例如“特殊援助计划”(SAP)下的中学，鼓励学生更广泛地使用母语，并可能偶尔教授普通话课程。一些学校已经在试验将语言学科与数学和科学结合起来的课程，使用英语和第二语言。

## Primary education 6-12 yrs
Primary education, normally starting at age **seven, is a four-year foundation stage (Primary 1 to 4) and a two-year orientation** stage (Primary 5 to 6). Primary education is compulsory under the Compulsory Education Act since 2003. Exemptions are made for pupils who are homeschooling, attending a full-time religious institution or those with special needs who are unable to attend mainstream schools. However, parents have to meet the requirements set out by the Ministry of Education before these exemptions are granted. Students have to take a test at Primary 4 to determine whether they could remain homeschooled. Primary education is free for all Singapore citizens in schools under the purview of the Ministry of Education, though there is a fee of up to SGD 13 monthly per student to help cover miscellaneous costs.

The foundation stage is the first stage of formal schooling. The four years, from primary 1 to 4, provide a foundation in English, mother tongue (which includes Standard Mandarin, Malay, Tamil or a Non-Tamil Indian Language (NTIL), such as Hindi, Punjabi and Bengali), **Mathematics and Science**. Other subjects include Civics and Moral Education, arts and crafts, music, health education, social studies, and physical education, which are taught throughout Primary 1 to 6. Science is taught from Primary 3 (age 9) onwards.

English is taught as a first language in primary school, with the Ministry of Education choosing to do so as English is the lingua franca of international business, science and technology. Therefore, a strong foundation in the English Language is considered an essential skill to develop. Bilingualism, is considered a cornerstone of Singapore's education system, and all students are required to choose a second, Mother Tongue Language (Chinese Language, Malay Language or Tamil Language) on enrollment into Primary school, to ensure that students can in future, tap the opportunities that can be found in the global environment. With more Primary 1 students coming from households where English is the dominant language spoken at home, the Ministry of Education has continued to refine the teaching of Mother Tongue Languages, with greater emphasis on listening and speaking skills.

All pupils advance to the orientation stage after Primary 4, where they are streamed according to the pupil's ability. The streaming system has been adjusted: previously, pupils were divided at Primary 5 to the EM1, EM2 and EM3 (English and Mother Tongue at 1st, 2nd and 3rd language respectively) streams, but since 2008 they are streamed according to subject under a scheme known as "Subject-based banding". Students take subjects at different levels based on their scores in the respective subjects at the end of Primary 4. The Mother Tongue subjects are offered at the higher, standard or foundation levels; Science and Maths can be taken at the standard or foundation levels.

After six years of Primary education, students will have to sit for the **national Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).** Students will then choose the secondary school of their choice based on their results at this examination; they will then be assigned to a secondary school based on merit and their choice. Students are also admitted into a secondary school under a separate "Direct School Admission" scheme, whereby secondary schools are able to choose a certain number of students based on their special talents before these students take the PSLE. Students admitted under this scheme cannot select their schools based on their PSLE results.

小学教育通常从7岁开始，分为**4年的基础阶段(小学1 - 4)和2年的适应**阶段(小学5 - 6)。对在家上学、就读全日制宗教机构或有特殊需要但无法就读主流学校的学生给予豁免。然而，在这些豁免被批准之前，家长必须满足教育部规定的要求。学生们必须在小学四年级参加考试，以决定他们能否继续在家自学。初等教育对新加坡教育部管辖范围内的所有公民都是免费的，不过每个学生**每月要缴纳最高13新元**的费用，以帮助支付杂项费用。

基础阶段是正规教育的第一阶段。从小学一年级到四年级的四年为英语、母语(包括标准普通话、马来语、泰米尔语或非泰米尔印度语(NTIL)，如印地语、旁遮普语和孟加拉语)、**数学和科学**打下了基础。其他课程包括公民及道德教育、工艺美术、音乐、健康教育、社会研究和体育，这些课程贯穿小学一至六年级。科学教育从小学三年级(9岁)开始。

由于英语是国际商务、科学和技术的通用语，所以教育部选择将英语作为小学的第一语言来教授。因此，扎实的英语基础被认为是发展的必要技能。双语,被认为是一个新加坡的教育体系的基石,和所有的学生被要求选择一个第二,母语语言(汉语、马来语语言或泰米尔语语言)登记到小学,以确保学生可以在未来,挖掘机会,可以在全局环境中找到。随着越来越多的小学一年级学生来自以英语为主要语言的家庭，教育部继续改进母语教学，更加强调听力和口语技能。

所有学生在小学四年级之后都将进入迎新阶段，在那里他们将根据学生的能力进行分组。流媒体系统已经进行了调整:以前，小学生在小学五年级被分成EM1、EM2和EM3(英语和母语分别为第一、第二和第三语言)流媒体，但自2008年以来，他们按照科目进行流媒体，这种模式被称为“基于科目的分班”。学生在小学四年级结束时，根据他们在各自科目上的分数，参加不同等级的课程。母语科目有较高、标准或基础程度;科学和数学可以达到标准或基础水平。

经过六年的小学教育，学生将不得不参加**全国小学毕业考试(PSLE)。**学生将根据他们在这次考试中的成绩来选择他们所选择的中学;然后，他们将根据成绩和他们的选择被分配到一所中学。学生亦可根据另一项“直接入学”计划入读中学，中学可根据学生的特殊才能选择一定数目的学生，然后才入读中学。根据这项计划录取的学生不能根据他们的PSLE成绩选择学校。
